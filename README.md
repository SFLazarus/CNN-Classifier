# CNN-Classifier
CNN Classifier written from scratch in python without using any libraries like Keras and Tensorflow

# Says One Neuron To Another
## Neural network architectures
1. Set up a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Pick two datasets from
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research
3. Choose a programming language (Python, C/C++, Java)
4. Formulate ideas on how neural networks can be used to accomplish the task for the specific dataset
5. Build a neural network to model the prediction process programmatically
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your source code, documentation and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub

# Dataset 1:

`tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(path="mnist.npz")`

- This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images. 
- x_train, x_test: uint8 arrays of grayscale image data with shapes (num_samples, 28, 28).
- y_train, y_test: uint8 arrays of digit labels (integers in range 0-9) with shapes (num_samples,).
- License: Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes hold the copyright of MNIST dataset, which is a derivative work from original NIST datasets. MNIST dataset is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license.

- The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

- Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

# Dataset 2:

`tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()`

- This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. This dataset can be used as a drop-in replacement for MNIST. The class labels are:

- Label	Description

- 0	T-shirt/top
- 1	Trouser
- 2	Pullover
- 3	Dress
- 4	Coat
- 5	Sandal
- 6	Shirt
- 7	Sneaker
- 8	Bag
- 9	Ankle boot

- Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Zalando intends Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

# Results and Future Developments:

- Our model trained pretty well but we could not obtain similar train and test accuracies this might be because of overfitting or not enough data to train our model or a shallow network with only one hidden layer.
- In future we can try to implement a deeper network with more hidden layers and also instead of initializing weights and biases with random values we can use some standard weights which are trained on more powerful machines.
